## Overview

Welcome to the Led-Controller project! This project comprises a mobile app built with Flutter and a controller using Arduino and PlatformIO. The main purpose is to control LED strips with a variety of colors and effects. The mobile app offers a user-friendly interface to modify colors and control the LED strip, and the Arduino code leverages the FastLED library for LED programming.
